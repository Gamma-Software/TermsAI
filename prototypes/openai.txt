Circle Terms of Service



Last updated: February 7, 2023


Circle is an all-in-one, white-labeled community platform for creators and brands, enabling them to create engaging discussions, live streams, chat, events, and memberships all in one place under their own brand. Circle is an online community platform for creators that helps them bring their discussions, memberships, and content to their audience and community, under the creator’s own brand.


These Terms of Service (these “Terms”) are a binding contract between you and CircleCo, Inc. (“we”, “us”, “our”, “Company”, or “Circle”). The Terms apply to your access to, and your use of our website at https://circle.so (our “Website”), our web and applications (our “App”) and our other online products or services that link to these Terms (collectively, the “Services”) through our Website or App.


By accessing or using our Services, you signify and agree that you have read, understood, and agree or consent to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree with or consent to being bound any of the Terms, you are not authorized to use our Services. You also acknowledge that you have read and understood how your personal information will be collected, used, and shared, as set forth in our Privacy Policy.



PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY TO ENSURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND EACH PROVISION. THESE TERMS CONTAIN A MANDATORY INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IN THE SECTION TITLED “DISPUTE RESOLUTION; BINDING ARBITRATION” AND A CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER PROVISION IN THE SECTION TITLED “CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER” THAT REQUIRE, WITH ONLY SPECIFIED EXCEPTIONS IN THE AFOREMENTIONED SECTIONS OR UNLESS YOU OPT OUT PURSUANT TO THE INSTRUCTIONS PROVIDED THEREIN, THE EXCLUSIVE USE OF FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS ONLY TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS, COLLECTIVE, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS OR PROCEEDINGS.

As provided in greater detail in these Terms (and without limiting the express language of these Terms), you acknowledge the following:



each component of our Services is licensed, not sold, to you, and you may use the Services only as set forth in these Terms;


the use of the Services may be subject to separate third-party terms of service and fees, including, without limitation, terms of service and fees from your mobile network operator, including fees charged for data usage and overage, which are solely your responsibility;


you consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of your personally identifiable information in accordance with our Privacy Policy;


the Services are provided “as is” without warranties of any kind and our liability to you is limited;


disputes arising under these Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration, as described below; and


if you are using our App on an iOS-based device, you agree to and acknowledge the “Notice Regarding Apple” below.




1. API Terms


Customers may access their Service data via the Application Program Interface (“API”). Any use of the API, including use of the API through a third-party product that accesses the Service, is bound by the Terms plus the following specific terms:



You may not sell, rent, lease, sublicense, redistribute, or syndicate access to our API.


You may not and you may not permit any third party to: (i) access our API or documentation in violation of any law or regulation; (ii) access our API in any manner that comprises, breaks, or circumvents any of our technical processes or security measures associated with the Services or in a way that poses a security vulnerability to customers or users of the Services; (iii) access our API or documentation in order to replicate or compete with the Services; (iv) attempt to reverse engineer or otherwise derive source code, trade secrets, or know-how of our API or Services; or (v) attempt to use our API in a manner that exceeds rate limits or constitutes excessive or abusive usage.


You expressly understand and agree that the Company shall not be liable for any damages or losses resulting from your use of the API or third-party products that access data via the API.



If we believe that there is a violation of the Terms that can simply be remedied by your modification or update of your usage, we will, in most cases ask you to take direct action rather than intervene. In some instances, we may directly step in and take what we determine to be appropriate action if you are not responsive, or if we believe there is a credible risk of harm to us, the Services, our customers, users, or any third parties.



2. Notice Regarding Apple


You acknowledge that these Terms are between you and Circle only, not with Apple, and Apple is not responsible for any App or the content thereof. Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to any App. In the event of any failure of any App to conform to any applicable warranty, then you may notify Apple and request that Apple refund the purchase price for the relevant App to you; and, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple has no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to any App. Apple is not responsible for addressing any claims by you or any third party relating to any App or your possession and/or use of any App, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that any App fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation.


Apple is not responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement, and discharge of any third party claim that any App or your possession and use of any App infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights. You will comply with any applicable third-party terms, when using any App. Apple, and Apple’s subsidiaries, are third-party beneficiaries of this section of these Terms, and upon your acceptance of these Terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce this section of these Terms against you as a third-party beneficiary of these Terms.


You hereby represent and warrant that: (a) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country; and (b) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties. If Circle provides a translation of the English language version of these Terms, the translation is provided solely for convenience, and the English version will prevail.



3. Third-Party Software


The software you download in connection with any App consists of a package of components, including certain third-party software provided under separate license terms. Your use of the third-party software in conjunction with the App in a manner consistent with the terms of these Terms is permitted, however, you may have broader rights under the applicable third-party terms and nothing in these Terms is intended to impose further restrictions on your use of the third-party software.



4. Target Audience


The Services are not targeted toward, marketed to, or intended for use by anyone under the age of 18. We encourage parents to supervise their children’s digital activities and to consider using parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers that help provide a child-friendly online environment. These tools can also keep children from disclosing their name, address and other personal information without parental consent online.


If you are using the Services on behalf of any person, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to accept these Terms on such person’s behalf and that such person agrees to be responsible to us if you or such person violates these Terms.



5. Accounts and Account Security




Eligibility: You must be at least 18 years of age to use our Services. By agreeing to these Terms, you represent and warrant to us that: (a) you are at least 18 years of age; (b) you have not previously been suspended or removed from our Services; and (c) your registration and your use of the Services complies with all applicable laws and regulations. If you are using the Services on behalf of an entity, organization, or company, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that entity, organization, or company to these Terms and that you agree on behalf of that entity, organization, or company to be bound by these Terms.


Registration: Anyone who is otherwise eligible to use the Services in accordance with these Terms may browse the public-facing pages of the Services. But to use most features of the Services, you must create an account (“Account”). Each Organization will designate an administrator for that Organization’s Account (the “Administrator”). Each Administrator may authorize other individuals from the same Organization to create an Account associated with that Organization (those authorized individuals, “Authorized Users”). Organizations, Administrators, and Authorized Users are, collectively, “Registered Users” and Registered Users and non-Registered Users are, collectively, “Users.”


Account Security: Your Account is personal to you, and you may not share your Account information with, or allow access to your Account by, any third party. As you will be responsible for all activity that occurs under your access credentials, you will use reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorized access to or use of the Services and to preserve the confidentiality of your username or email address and password, and any device that you use to access the Services. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password. Note, if you write into customer support requesting assistance, we are able to reset or set specific passwords for you. However, after you are able to login successfully, we encourage you to change your password. If you have any reason to believe that your account credentials have been compromised or that your Account has been accessed by a third party, you will immediately notify Circle via e-mail at legal@circle.so. Please note that Circle is able to mask into your account to see your account’s perspective for customer support and moderation purposes. You will be solely responsible for the losses incurred by Circle and others due to any unauthorized use of your Account.

Circle is not required to treat any Submissions as confidential, and will not incur any liability as a result of any similarities that may appear in future Circle endeavors. Circle will have exclusive ownership of all present and future existing rights, including all commercial rights, to the Submission of every kind and nature in perpetuity throughout the universe, without acknowledgment or compensation to you.

15. Dispute Resolution; Binding Arbitration


READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US. This Section (the “Arbitration Agreement”) applies to and governs any dispute, controversy, or claim between you and us that arises out of or relates to, directly or indirectly: (a) these Terms, including the formation, existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, validity, or enforceability thereof; (b) access to or use of the Services, including receipt of any advertising, marketing, or other communications from us; (c) any transactions through, by, or using the Services; or (d) any other aspect of your relationship or transactions with us, directly or indirectly, as a user or consumer (“Claim” or collectively, “Claims”). The Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all Claims that arose or were asserted before or after your consent to these Terms.


If you are a new user, you can reject and opt-out of this Arbitration Agreement within thirty (30) days of accepting these Terms by emailing us at legal@circle.so with your first and last name and stating your intent to opt-out of the Arbitration Agreement. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement does not affect the binding nature of any other part of these Terms, including the provisions regarding controlling law or in which courts any disputes must be brought.


For any Claim, you agree to first contact us at legal@circle.so and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that we have not been able to resolve a Claim after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any Claim through binding arbitration by JAMS, under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for JAMS (the “Rules”), except as provided herein. JAMS may be contacted at www.jamsadr.com, where the Rules are available. In the event of any conflict between the Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, the Arbitration Agreement shall control. The arbitration will be conducted in the U.S. county where you live or Kings County, New York, unless you and we agree otherwise. If you are using the Services for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules, and the award rendered by the arbitrator will include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. If you are an individual using the Services for non-commercial purposes: (i) JAMS may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from JAMS; (ii) the award rendered by the arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorney’s fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and (iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. You and we agree that the arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitrator shall also be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether these Terms, or any provision of these Terms, is unconscionable or illusory or any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, unconscionability, or estoppel.


NOTHING IN THIS SECTION WILL BE DEEMED AS: PREVENTING US FROM SEEKING INJUNCTIVE OR OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF FROM THE COURTS AS NECESSARY TO PREVENT THE ACTUAL OR THREATENED INFRINGEMENT, MISAPPROPRIATION, OR VIOLATION OF OUR DATA SECURITY, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OR OTHER PROPRIETARY RIGHTS; OR PREVENTING YOU FROM ASSERTING CLAIMS IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT, IF YOUR CLAIMS QUALIFY AND SO LONG AS THE MATTER REMAINS IN SUCH COURT AND ADVANCES ON ONLY AN INDIVIDUAL (NON-CLASS, NON-COLLECTIVE, AND NON-REPRESENTATIVE) BASIS.


If this Arbitration Agreement is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, shall be severed. Severance of the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, shall have no impact on the remaining provisions of the Arbitration Agreement, which shall remain in force, or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, because it would prevent you from seeking public injunctive relief, then any dispute regarding the entitlement to such relief (and only that relief) must be severed from arbitration and may be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction. All other claims for relief subject to arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement shall be arbitrated under its terms, and the parties agree that litigation of any dispute regarding the entitlement to public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.



16. Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver


WITH RESPECT TO ALL PERSONS AND ENTITIES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY HAVE OBTAINED OR USED THE SERVICES FOR PERSONAL, COMMERCIAL OR OTHER PURPOSES, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS. YOU AND CIRCLE AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND CIRCLE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND.



17. Governing Law and Venue


These Terms, your access to and use of the Services, and any claim or dispute you may bring against Circle, its affiliates, subsidiaries, parent companies, members, shareholders, agents and assigns, shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.
